# Network Monitoring and Security Solution

## Overview
This project integrates Zabbix, Grafana, Graylog, and Wazuh to create a comprehensive network monitoring and security solution. The goal is to centralize monitoring, alerting, and logging to improve efficiency and security.

## Architecture
The architecture of our solution includes:
- **Zabbix**: Collects data using various techniques to monitor network and server performance.
- **Wazuh**: Collects security alerts and logs, sending them to Graylog.
- **Graylog**: Normalizes and processes the data received from Wazuh.
- **Grafana**: Displays all collected data in a unified dashboard for easy visualization.

## Features
- **Centralized Monitoring**: All data is collected and visualized in one place, Grafana.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notifications for any issues or security threats.
- **Data Normalization**: Graylog processes and normalizes data for consistency.
- **Security Monitoring**: Wazuh provides detailed security alerts and logs.

## Benefits
- **Improved Efficiency**: Centralized dashboard in Grafana allows for quick overview and analysis.
- **Enhanced Security**: Real-time alerts and comprehensive logging improve the security posture.
- **Scalability**: The architecture can be expanded to include additional monitoring tools or data sources.

## Challenges
- **Integration Complexity**: Ensuring seamless communication between Zabbix, Wazuh, Graylog, and Grafana.
- **Custom Configurations**: Creating custom Zabbix items and dashboards in Grafana for specific monitoring needs.
- **Data Normalization**: Standardizing logs and metrics from various sources.

## Opportunities
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Integrate AI to enhance data analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Expanded Monitoring**: Extend monitoring capabilities to cloud services like Azure and SOTI.
- **User Experience**: Improve user interfaces and create user-friendly dashboards for non-technical users.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a powerful solution for network monitoring and security by leveraging open-source tools. The integration of Zabbix, Grafana, Graylog, and Wazuh provides a robust and scalable platform to monitor, alert, and secure IT infrastructure effectively.
